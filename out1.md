Let $E, F$ be normed spaces with norms $\|\cdot\|_{E},\|\cdot\|_{F}$. Show that for a map $f: E \rightarrow F$ and $a \in E$, the following two statements are equivalent:



(i) For every given $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that $\|f(x)-f(a)\|_{F}<\varepsilon$ whenever $\|x-a\|_{E}<\delta$



(ii) $f\left(x_{n}\right) \rightarrow f(a)$ for each sequence $x_{n} \rightarrow a$.



We say that $f$ is continuous at $a$ if (i), or equivalently (ii), holds.



Let now $\left(E,\|\cdot\|_{E}\right)$ be a normed space. Let $A \subset E$ be a non-empty closed subset and define $d(x, A)=\inf \left\{\|x-a\|_{E}: a \in A\right\}$. Show that
