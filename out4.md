The mathematics course at the University of Barchester is a three-year one. After the end-of-year examinations there are three possibilities:



(i) failing and leaving (probability $p$ );



(ii) taking that year again (probability $q$ );



(iii) going on to the next year (or graduating, if the current year is the third one) (probability $r$ ).



Thus there are five states for a student $\left(1^{\text {st }}\right.$ year, $2^{\text {nd }}$ year, $3^{\text {rd }}$ year, left without a degree, graduated).



Write down the $5 \times 5$ transition matrix. Classify the states, assuming $p, q, r \in(0,1)$. Find the probability that a student will eventually graduate.

The efficacy of a new medicine was tested as follows. Fifty patients were given the medicine, and another fifty patients were given a placebo. A week later, the number of patients who got better, stayed the same, or got worse was recorded, as summarised in this table:



\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}

\hline & medicine & placebo \\

better & 28 & 22 \\

same & 4 & 16 \\

worse & 18 & 12 \\

\hline

\end{tabular}



Conduct a Pearson chi-squared test of size $1 \%$ of the hypothesis that the medicine and the placebo have the same effect.
