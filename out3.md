$$\frac{d y}{d t}=f(y)$$



is given by



$$y_{n+1}=y_{n}+h\left(b_{1} k_{1}+b_{2} k_{2}+b_{3} k_{3}\right),$$

The cop then moves according to $P$ independently of the robber until the cop catches the robber (i.e., the cop visits the state occupied by the robber). Compute the expected amount of time for the cop to catch the robber.

Consider the functional



$$I[y]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2} y^{\prime 2}+\frac{1}{2} U(y)^{2}\right) d x$$



where $y(x)$ is subject to boundary conditions $y(x) \rightarrow a_{\pm}$as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$ with $U\left(a_{\pm}\right)=0$. [You may assume the integral converges.]



(a) Find expressions for the first-order and second-order variations $\delta I$ and $\delta^{2} I$ resulting from a variation $\delta y$ that respects the boundary conditions.



(b) If $a_{\pm}=a$, show that $I[y]=0$ if and only if $y(x)=a$ for all $x$. Explain briefly how this is consistent with your results for $\delta I$ and $\delta^{2} I$ in part (a).



(c) Now suppose that $U(y)=c^{2}-y^{2}$ with $a_{\pm}=\pm c(c>0)$. By considering an integral of $U(y) y^{\prime}$, show that



$$I[y] \geqslant \frac{4 c^{3}}{3},$$



with equality if and only if $y$ satisfies a first-order differential equation. Deduce that global minima of $I[y]$ with the specified boundary conditions occur precisely for



$$y(x)=c \tanh \left\{c\left(x-x_{0}\right)\right\}$$



where $x_{0}$ is a constant. How is the first-order differential equation that appears in this case related to your general result for $\delta I$ in part (a)?
